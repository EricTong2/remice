Description: The `remice` package contains four functions that are all aimed to help clean and analyze datasets, especially those related to mice experiments. These functions include:
    -analyze_type takes a column and determines if any values in that row are not of a specified type, which could cause errors for other functions
    -table_different creates a table of strings that are uncommonly found
    -separate_list creates a table of the most common responses, when multiple responses could exist in one row. 
    For example, this could be used on a survey about comfort foods, where a response might be ""
    -plot_outliers uses longitunial data and checks for any abnormally large changes in the data. The user inputs a percent change, and any points above that will be plotted.
